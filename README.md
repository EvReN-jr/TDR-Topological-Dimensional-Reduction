# TDR: Topological Dimensional Reduction
This method allows for topological dimensionality reduction on the data. In this method, the columns of the reduced data set are from the original data set.

## Transform 
This function convert data into categories (1,2,3,4,...) based on standard deviation.

## Core
This function finds the core according to topological methods. This core show us how important which column is.

## TDR
This version is primal version, not effective with big amounts data.
It outputs the important column numbers (with index +1) and their importance levels as a list.


## TDR_V2
This version is much faster.
It outputs the important column numbers (with index +1) and their importance levels as a list.
